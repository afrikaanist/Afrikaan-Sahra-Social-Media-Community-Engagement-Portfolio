      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I am a social media strategist and community advocate with a passion for
        creating inclusive digital experiences. With a degree in Computer
        Science and a Business Specialization from Seattle University, I blend
        technical expertise with storytelling and data‑driven strategies to
        engage diverse audiences. My journey as a Somali refugee fuels my
        commitment to equity and social justice, and my work spans
        community‑led initiatives, voter engagement campaigns and business
        development support. I have led social media campaigns, built digital
        platforms and collaborated across teams to deliver creative, impactful
        projects.

          Conceptualised and managed a storytelling campaign for Tech4Refugees that
